Before you dive into making some complex, Cryptid-level Joker,
we're going to start with the basics.

The most basic joker in the game is just the Joker, which gives +4 Mult.
What's nice about this is that you get to see a lot of parts of Jokers without doing too much complex work.

Start by using `SMODS.Joker`:

```lua {"1":2} {"2":5-7} {"3": 10} {"4": 13-15} {"5": 18-22}
SMODS.Joker({
    key = "joker_2",
    loc_txt = {
        name = "Joker 2",
        text = {
            "{C:mult}+#1#{} Mult"
        }
    }
    loc_vars = function(self, info_queue, card)
        return {vars = {card.ability.extra.mult}}
    end
    config = {
        extra = {
            mult = 4
        }
    },
    calculate = function(self, context, card)
        if context.joker_main then
            return {
                mult = card.ability.extra.mult
            }
        end
    end
})
```

To start, Section #1 is the _key_ of your joker. 
This is part of how the code refers to your joker card.

> This key is actually just a fraction of the full, internal key.<br/>
In full, it's `j_[mod prefix]_key` (ex. `j_exmpl_joker_2`)

In the `loc_txt` block, we define the `name` (self explanatory) of our joker.
The `text` table (Section #2) is a list of strings, with each string representing one line.

The `{C:mult}` part colors all the text before the closing `{}` will color the text red.

<blockquote>
There are other values you can use for `{C:}`, try these out:
- attention
- chips
- tarot
- planet
