About two weeks ago, I bought the game [Friends vs. Friends](https://friendsvsfriends.com), which is really good.

When I picked up the game, I bounced between a few different characters, but I've landed on one that I now main: Stevie Gull.

    Stevie is definitely a high-tier, in my opinion. 
    
    While your milage mainly depends on how well you can use their weapon (more on that later),
    they're a pretty reliable pick in any situation.

This post is designed to be my understanding of how to play the character,
but bear in mind that I'm not an expert or anything. There are a lot of better players in the
[Fvf Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/RH5qcunBc6) 
that are much better equipped to talk with any sort of authority.

## The Weapon
---
The main reason I picked up Stevie in the first place was to improve my aim.

    Stevie starts with the Golden Boira, which is a better version of the default weapon,
    the Boira.

    If you haven't played FvF, just know that the Boira is basically a Glock 9.

The most important parts of the Golden Boira (to me, at least) are its much better accuracy
and damage falloff[^1] stats, not to mention a higher damage output overall.
The Golden only starts to lose damage at over 80 meters, while the default Boira starts losing damage at 35[^2].

Of course, this only helps if you actually hit your shots, which was the whole point.
Stevie really starts to shine when you synergize the cards with the gun.

## The Deck 
---
My personal deck for Stevie[^3] has seen significant changes since I've started out, but I'll try my best to explain it.

Most of the heavy lifting of my deck revolves around enhancing the Golden, because why not improve on something already great? 
That's why **Steel Bullets**, **More Accuracy**, and **Quick Reload** make an appearance.

The debuffs in my deck revolve around inconveniencing the other player, 
like reducing their damage/accuracy and generally making them have worse of a time.

The rest of the deck kind of revolve around getting out of bad situations, 
like using **Teleport Bomb** or **Ninja Log** to make a quick getaway.

I also make use of **Card Thief**, **Extra Cards**, and **Card Profaner** to get more into my hand, 
just in case.

## The Mindset
---
Because of Stevie's Golden Boira, you can afford to hang back a little more, as you'll get pretty much equivalent damage.
This causes your opponents to try to close the distance, so using any tools you have against that will be vital (try **Land Mine**).

If you're going to play more aggressively, make sure you take the appropriate measures 
such as using health cards and evasion tactics. I'm a big fan of **Ninja Log** + **Medkit**.

After all of that, just make sure you're practicing your aim and tracking skills. 
Like I mentioned before, taking the better weapon doesn't help if you never hit anything.

## In Conclusion
---
I may or may not follow this up with more specific information, like positions and matchups.
I'll definitely have to do more research for that. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

A closer: why do they look so pissed in this image? I don't get it.
